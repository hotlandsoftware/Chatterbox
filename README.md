# Chatterbox
A LAN instant messaging program made in VB.Net that I made back in 2014. The latest version was made in 2016.

The program has all your basic instant messaging features. You can chat and change your username. The way it works is you enter the IP of someone on your LAN, then they enter yours, and voila - you are chatting with them! It's like magic. It also works with LogMeIn so you can chat with someone over the internet.

Features include:
- A changelog!
- Customize the chat interface
- Chatting (obviously)
- Help Topics
- Locker 
- Multiple language support

Probably doesn't have the best coding practices, but oh well. Also I don't have the code for version 0.01 - 2.01 anymore but you can probably use a decompiler to get the code to if you really want to know...

Also, apparently someone wrote a bunch of comments. I'll keep them in because it's funny.

What it works on (tested)
- Windows 98
- Windows 2000
- Windows XP (RTM and SP3)
- Windows Vista 
- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10

...and all of their respective Server counterparts.
